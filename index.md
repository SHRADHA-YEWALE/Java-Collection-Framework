# Collection Framework in Java

### What is the Collection framework: 
The collection framework in java provides many interfaces and classes which gives the programmer access to prepackaged data structures as well as algorithms for manipulating them.

_Collection interface and Map interface are two main interfaces of java collection framework._

## Collection Interface :

**_One of the advantages of the Collection framework is that it provides consistent API → [The classes that implements common interfaces share the common methods] e.g. Since then classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack implements common interface List, They share all the methods of List, Collection and Iterable interface._**

## Map Interface :
Map interface provides interface and classes which represents a mapping between key and value.

Every interface and class in the Collection interface as well as in the Map interface have some significance. Let's see their significance in form of a flow diagram. The following flow diagram depicts the significance of which class or interface to be used based on the respective requirements.
